Change log for BlueProximity

1.3.1 Almost everything back to normal!
- fixed: Now it correctly updates the system tray icon according to the proximity/paused/gone/back state
- fixed: Now it correctly differentiates what mouse button was clicked, and then either shows/hides the main
         window or display the contextual menu
- fixed: Now it won't show an exception error message on startup. Though it was harmless, it was annoying all the same!

1.3.0 Upgrade to Python 3 (tested on version 3.8) and GTK3
- info: This is a fork from the original codebase! And this update is intended solely for the purpose
