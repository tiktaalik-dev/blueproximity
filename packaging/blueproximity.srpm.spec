%description
Original by Lars Friedrichs and Rodrigo Gambra-Middleton (rodrigo@tiktaalik.dev)

If you move away from your computer and the distance is above a certain level for a given time, it automatically locks your desktop (or starts any other shell command you want).

Once away your computer awaits its master back - if you are nearer than a given level for a set time your computer unlocks magically without any interaction (or starts any other shell command you want).

See the doc/ directory or the website which both contain a manual with screenshots.

Note beware Bluetooth MAC spoofing. This will only work with paired devices for security. Does not support BTLE.
